## What is ylog?

ylog is a lightweight TypeScript CLI tool that transforms your GitHub pull request history into **institutional memory** for your development team. It creates structured context that helps both humans and AI understand not just *what* your code does, but *why* it evolved that way.

## How it works

ylog follows a simple three-step process:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Fetch PR Data">
    Connects to GitHub API (via Octokit) to fetch comprehensive PR metadata including files, reviews, and labels
  </Step>
  <Step title="AI Summarization">
    Processes each PR with AI to extract the "why" - business impact, technical changes, and affected areas
  </Step>
  <Step title="Generate Context">
    Creates both SQLite database for structured queries and .ylog files in relevant directories for easy discovery
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Recent Changes (3 PRs, last 6 months)

### #23: Add OAuth 2.0 support
**2025-05-20** by @alice • `oauth.ts`, `middleware.ts`, `types.ts`

This is just a preview - ylog context files include much more detail including regeneration instructions, file lists, and links to the full tool.
